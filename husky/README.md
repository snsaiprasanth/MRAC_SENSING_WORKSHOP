## Tmux
tmux is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It enables users to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal window or remote terminal. With tmux, you can divide your terminal into panes, each displaying its own terminal session or command-line interface. This allows you to multitask, run commands simultaneously, and organize your workflow efficiently.
